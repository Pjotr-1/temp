# temp
Simple project with the Arduino-compatible RFduino for wireless outdoor temperature measurement using the Gazell protocol and the TMP36 sensor.

It consists of one outdoor sensor unit (device0) and one indoor display unit (host). Data packets are sent from the sensor unit to the display unit using the Gazell network.

The code is dependent of two libraries;
- TM1637 4-digit display - GyverTM1637
- RFduino library
